## Milestones
The project was made at the MHacks Hackathon. Following are some of the upcoming milestones:
- [ ] **Remove API dependency completely.** I will be rewriting all my code to run on javascript. That would involve reinventing the wheel because javascript doesn't have a great NLP ecosystem just yet.
- [ ] **Preserve paragraph styles.** When the text is replaced, styles of children components are lost. I want to focus some time to solve this problem!
